2. The "whole pizza" image should fill the top of the page, at full width.
3. The header containing the title and subtitle should be underneath the `.pizza-header` image.
4. The 3 images should follow and be fully opaque (`opacity` of 1)
5. The `background-color` of the website should be the company's primary color
6. Other texts on the website should be white.
7. Hyperlinks should appear in a "magenta" `color`.
8. The footer of the website should be grey
9. No cursive `font-family` please (`serif` and `san-serif`) only
10. On mobile, the images in the image grid should stack in a column (hint: `flex-direction` should change)
